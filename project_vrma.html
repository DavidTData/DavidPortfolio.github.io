					<h1>The Vancouver Rental Market</h1>
				</header>
				<p>The most basic question I can ask is "how much does rent cost in Vancouver?"</p>

				<p>
					One source that might have an answer is the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).
					The CMHC conducts yearly surveys on rental markets across Canada, and usefully offers data on a
					neighborhood basis.
					Using data from their 2022 survey, I can use SQL to focus in on rental prices across Vancouver
					neighborhoods.
					For simplicity I will examine only one bedroom prices.

				</p>

				<p>

				<header>
					<h4>SQL Query:</h4>
				</header>
				<pre><code>SELECT survey_zone, one_bed 
	FROM combinedurms
	WHERE survey_year='2022' AND
	dwelling_type='Total' AND
	survey_zone IN ('Marpole',
			'East Hastings',
			'Southeast Vancouver',
			'South Granville & Oak',
			'Vancouver (CY)',
			'West End & Stanley Park',
			'Westside & Kerrisdale',
			'Kitsilano & Point Grey',
			'English Bay',
			'Downtown')
	ORDER BY one_bed
;</code></pre>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/Rental Prices Query Output.png"
							alt="Results of SQL query" /></span>
					Across the entire city
					of Vancouver (listed as "Vancouver (CY)"), one-bedroom renters pay an
					average of $1629 per month.
					Perhaps unsurprisingly, residents of Downtown Vancouver pay the highest average rent for a one
					bedroom unit, at
					$1840 per month. As a general trend, one-bedroom renters tend to pay more the further north and west
					they live.
				</p>

				</p>
				This table can easily be visualised as a bar chart, using Tableau.
				</p>

				<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2022 Rent (CMHC).png" alt="" /></span></p>

				<p>
					The average for the whole of Vancouver is marked in red for clarity.
				</p>

				<p>
					While this can answer the most basic question about Vancouver's rental market ("how much does rent
					cost?"),
					it suffers from a lack of context. For example, one might wonder how Vancouver rental prices compare
					to prices in
					other cities, or how rental prices in 2022 compare to prior years.
				</p>

				<p>
					Helpfully, the CMHC rental survey includes every Canadian urban centre with over
					10,000 residents, and has been conducted annually since 2006. I'll start with a cross-sectional
					analysis to get a sense of how Vancouver compares to other cities.
				</p>

				<p>
					Naturally, comparing Vancouver to every urban centre with over 10,000 people is impractical - there
					are over 1000.
					Narrowing down areas presents a problem though. So far I have only analysised the City of Vancouver.
					But neighbouring cities are often grouped together into metropolitan areas -
					the City of Vancouver is just one of several municipalities in the Greater Vancouver metro area.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not uncommon for people to work in one city of a metro area and live in another,
					or to move between cities in the same metro area.
					As such, we would expect the rental markets of urban centres in the same metro area to be
					interconnected.
					This means that a comparison between the City of Vancouver and other cites could be more or less
					useful than a comparison between
					Greater Vancouver and other metro areas.
				</p>

				<p>
					For completeness, I will make comparisons at both municipal and metro levels of analysis.

							Within the Greater Vancouver Area, renters in the City of Vancouver pay the fifth highest
							one-bedroom prices, on average. This places them behind both the District of North Vancouver
							the City of North Vancouver, as well as the census subdivision "Greater Vancouver A" (which
							most prominently includes the University Endowment Lands) and West Vancouver. <br></br>

							Across the entire Greater Vancouver Area, a one-bedroom renter paid an average of $1543 a
							month in 2022.
						<p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/Municipal Comparisons Output.png"
									alt="" /></span>
							Among major Canadian municipalities, the City of Vancouver ranks as the most expensive for
							one-bedroom renters. Vancouver's average of $1629 beat out more populace cities like Toronto
							($1537), Calgary ($1224), and Montreal ($909)
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Metro Comparisons Output.png" alt="" /></span>
							Likewise, Greater Vancouver ranks as the most expensive major metro area in Canada in terms
							of one-bedroom rent. Once again, that places it ahead of the Greater Toronto Area ($1526)
							and Greater Montreal ($912), Canada's two most populated metro areas.

					<p>
						As we can see, the average monthly rent Vancouver-wide increased from $1067 in 2012 to $1629 in
						2022. This represented an increase of $562, or 52.7%.
					</p>

					<p>
						I should note that data from the CMHC's rental market surveys has a limitation, in that it
						represents the prices that current renters are paying. To illustrate the problem this poses, I
						will
						compare the CMHC's data
						with data from Zumper.
					</p>

					<p><span class="image fit"><img src="images/2022 Rent CMHC vs Zumper.png" alt="" /></span>
						The CMHC estimates average rent by surveying current renters, which means it
						represents the average price among all current renters. However, we wouldn't expect all kinds of
						renters to pay similiar rents; in particular, we would expect long-time rents
						to pay less in rent that new renters, on average. This is a result of long-time renters being
						covered by rent control, among other factors. Because Zumper's data
						is taken from current rental listing, rather than current renters, the average provided by
						Zumper
						better reflects what someone looking to rent a new unit would expect to pay.
						On the other hand, the CMHC average better represents the rent paid by current renters.</p>
